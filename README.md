# IESopt Cookiecutter Templates

This allows setting up pre-defined project structures for IESopt projects.

## Using this template

**1. Installing Cookiecutter:**

Consult the [Cookiecutter documentation](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for the most up-to-date installation instructions.

If you have Python (and pip) available, you can install Cookiecutter with the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user cookiecutter
```

**2. Applying the template:**

```bash
cookiecutter gh:ait-energy/IESopt-Cookiecutter-Templates
```

**3. Setup a version control system:**

After successfully using the template, immediately setup `git` (e.g., by using `git init`), and - if applicable - also setup a remote repository (e.g., on GitLab, GitHub). This is important to keep track of changes and to collaborate with others.

> Note: The template contains various `.gitkeep` files, which are used to keep empty directories in the repository. These files are not necessary for the project and can be removed if desired.
